The laptop is based on the 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H 6-core processor, which is said to be one of the best processors for gaming laptops that offers up to 4.5GHz clock speed and comes with a TDP of 45W, which makes a laptop powered by this CPU an efficient machine.
<br><br>
The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 is one such laptop that manages to offer a good amount of performance for both gamers and professional usages like photo and video editing. I have been using the Acer Predator Helios 300 2020 from the last couple of weeks and here is a detailed review of the same, which retails in India for Rs. 1,19,990.
<br><br>
<h1>Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 Hardware Specifications </h1>

<br><br>
<h1>Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 Design</h1>

<br><br>

 The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 looks like a typical gaming laptop with a metal finish. The laptop weighs 2.7KG, which makes it a bit heavy. One of the reasons for the heavyweight is that the laptop includes a dedicated GPU with an active cooling system, which includes multiple fans.
<br>

The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 offers solid build quality and the laptop does not show any signs of flex, assuring a long-lasting life span. Even in terms of I/O, the laptop has three USB 3.0 ports, RJ-45 ethernet jack, full-sized HDMI out, an USB Type-C port and a headphone jack, which covers the base and one can use almost any accessories without using a dongle.

<h1>Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 CPU Performance</h1>

<br>
The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 is based on the 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H processor, which is a 6-core processor with a base clock speed of 2.6GHz and a boost clock speed of 4.5GHz. This CPU uses 14nm lithography and offers 12MB of cache with a bus speed of 8GT/s (gig transfer) with a peak TDP of 45W.
<br><br>

This is a great processor for both gaming and professional usage, as it has a peak clock speed of 4.5GHz, which will be helpful for gaming and having 12 threads will help with video and graphics rending. We ran a couple of CPU centric benchmarks on the Intel Core i7-9750H and here are the following results.
<br><br>

As this CPU has a base clock speed of 2.6GHz, the laptop will offer good battery life. Tasks like browsing the web, working on a presentation or even watching a movie do not require higher clock speed and due to the lower base clock speed, the laptop will consume less battery while doing normal tasks, offering good battery life.
<br><br>
<h1>Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 GPU/Gaming Performance</h1>

<br>

The Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52 comes with the Nvidia GTX 1660Ti, which is not the best GPU that we have seen on a laptop that costs Rs. 1,19,990. However, considering the fact that the laptop has a 1080p display, and the combination of the GPU and CPU can run most of the games at 60+ fps. In fact, some older games like GTA V can offer 90+ fps.
